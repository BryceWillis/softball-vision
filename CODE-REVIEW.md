# Code Review

**Reviewer:** Claude (Senior Software Architect)
**Last updated:** 2026-06-30
**Review passes:** 5 (Pass 5: setup-roster command and CR-19 cleanup; CR-20/21/22 resolved in re-review)

This document is the running record of architectural observations, bugs, and improvement recommendations for the `sidelinehd-extractor` codebase. It is updated after each review pass. Items move to **Resolved** once confirmed fixed.

## Status Workflow

- **Open**: reviewed finding is accepted as work to do.
- **Ready for Review**: Codex has implemented the change and verified tests; awaiting reviewer/user confirmation.
- **Resolved**: reviewer/user has confirmed the implementation and moved the item to the Resolved section.
- **Deferred**: valid finding, but intentionally postponed.

Codex may update an Open item to **Ready for Review** after implementing it and should include a short implementation note. The reviewer/user owns moving items from Open to Resolved after reviewing the diff and behavior.

## Open Items

#### CR-20 — `_format_roster_next_command` hardcodes the default template path
**File:** [cli.py](src/sidelinehd_extractor/cli.py)
**Resolved:** Pass 5 re-review

Hint now uses `--template YOUR_TEMPLATE`. Unit test updated to match. Clean fix.

#### CR-21 — `_read_roster_lines_interactive` has zero test coverage
**File:** [cli.py](src/sidelinehd_extractor/cli.py)
**Resolved:** Pass 5 re-review

Direct test added using patched `builtins.input` with a double-blank terminator sequence. Test correctly asserts the returned list includes the trailing single blank (appended before the break) and stops before the second blank. 133 tests pass.

#### CR-22 — `default_roster_path` returns a cwd-relative path with no guard or documentation
**File:** [roster.py](src/sidelinehd_extractor/roster.py)
**Resolved:** Pass 5 re-review

TTY confirmation prompt now shows `output_path.expanduser().resolve()` (absolute path). Test added that patches `builtins.input` with a `FakeTTY` stdin and confirms the resolved path appears in the prompt string. 133 tests pass.

#### CR-23 — `infer_batting_half` accumulates match counts before the `roster is None` guard
**File:** [events.py](src/sidelinehd_extractor/events.py)
**Resolved:** Pass 5 re-review

Loop now always counts at-bat totals; match step guarded with `if roster is not None`. The `roster is None` branch is checked after the loop and returns real `top_at_bats`/`bottom_at_bats` with zeroed match counts. Regression test updated to assert `top_at_bats == 1`. 133 tests pass.

## Resolved Items

#### CR-19 — `_event_has_roster_name_match` has an unused `roster` parameter
**File:** [events.py](src/sidelinehd_extractor/events.py)
**Resolved:** Pass 5

#### CR-18 — Tesseract missing-binary error message is macOS-only
**File:** [ocr.py](src/sidelinehd_extractor/ocr.py)
**Resolved:** Pass 3

`_tesseract_install_hint()` branches on `sys.platform` for darwin, linux, and win, with a generic fallback for unrecognised platforms. Tests cover all three specific platforms via `patch`. 111 tests pass.

#### CR-10a — `export_paths` return type is untyped
**File:** [workflow.py](src/sidelinehd_extractor/workflow.py)
**Resolved:** Pass 3

`export_paths` now returns `tuple[Path, Path]`. 100 tests pass.

---

#### CR-10b — `PathLike` alias defined in two modules
**Files:** [models.py](src/sidelinehd_extractor/models.py), [video.py](src/sidelinehd_extractor/video.py), [crops.py](src/sidelinehd_extractor/crops.py)
**Resolved:** Pass 3

`PathLike` consolidated into `models.py`; `video.py` and `crops.py` import the shared alias. 100 tests pass.

---

#### CR-10c — `format_inning_header` type annotation disagrees with implementation
**File:** [exports.py](src/sidelinehd_extractor/exports.py)
**Resolved:** Pass 3

`format_inning_header` now accepts `Optional[int]`, matching the existing `None` guard. 100 tests pass.

---

#### CR-13 — Frame read errors omit video duration
**File:** [video.py](src/sidelinehd_extractor/video.py)
**Resolved:** Pass 3

`read_frame_at` and `read_frames_at` now include duration in frame-read error messages by probing FPS and frame count from the already-open OpenCV capture. `_capture_duration_seconds` returns `None` if either property is unavailable, so the message degrades gracefully. Fake-capture unit tests added for both functions; 100 tests pass.

---

#### CR-17 — `PROJECT_CREDIT` duplicated in `test_workflow.py`
**File:** [tests/test_workflow.py](tests/test_workflow.py)
**Resolved:** Pass 3

`test_workflow.py` now imports `PROJECT_CREDIT` from `sidelinehd_extractor.exports`; local copy removed. 100 tests pass.

---

#### CR-14 — `ruff` not listed as a dev dependency
**File:** [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml)
**Resolved:** Pass 3

`ruff>=0.4` added to `[project.optional-dependencies] dev`. README "Development Checks" section added with dev install, test, and lint commands. 98 tests pass.

---

#### CR-15 — README misstates OCR default for primary commands
**File:** [README.md](README.md)
**Resolved:** Pass 3

Setup section and OCR section now correctly state that `run-game`/`run-youtube` default to `--ocr tesseract`, and that `--ocr none` is the explicit debug/no-OCR mode for lower-level `process` use. 98 tests pass.

---

#### CR-01 — No license file
**File:** repo root
**Resolved:** Pass 3

`LICENSE` (MIT, copyright Ryan Moore 2026) created at repo root. `## License` section added to README with a link to the file — this final fix was applied by the reviewer, not Codex.

---

#### CR-16 — README pre-release cleanup: specific URLs and team names in examples
**File:** [README.md](README.md)
**Resolved:** Pass 3

Real YouTube video ID (`j4At63cNpkc`) replaced with `YOUR_VIDEO_ID`; team-specific slug (`smash_it_sports_12u_flx_ice`) replaced with `your_team_game_name` throughout. "Current State" section removed (the intro paragraph already covers what the tool does without WIP framing).

---

#### CR-02 — CLI leaked raw tracebacks on common user errors
**File:** [cli.py:806-822](src/sidelinehd_extractor/cli.py#L806-L822)
**Resolved:** Pass 2

`main()` now catches `json.JSONDecodeError` (with a dedicated clear message), plus `(ValueError, FileNotFoundError, OSError)`. The original yt-dlp and OCR error handlers are intact. Correct fix.

---

#### CR-03 — `smooth_states` mutated frozen dataclasses in place
**File:** [state.py:187](src/sidelinehd_extractor/state.py#L187)
**Resolved:** Pass 2

Was assigning `state.inning = inning` / `state.half = half` directly. Now uses `dataclasses.replace(state, inning=inning, half=half)`. Correct fix.

---

#### CR-04 — `OverlayState` was the only mutable core model
**File:** [models.py:131](src/sidelinehd_extractor/models.py#L131)
**Resolved:** Pass 2

`OverlayState` is now `@dataclass(frozen=True)`, consistent with `Video`, `RegionFraction`, `OCRSample`, `Event`, and `Correction`. After CR-03 was fixed, this was safe to apply.

---

#### CR-06 — `parse_inning` OCR heuristics were undocumented
**File:** [state.py:91-92](src/sidelinehd_extractor/state.py#L91-L92)
**Resolved:** Pass 2

The `"4..."` → TOP and `"7..."` → BOTTOM prefix handling now has a comment explaining that SidelineHD's half-inning arrow can OCR as a leading digit fused with the inning number. Exactly the right amount of explanation.

---

#### CR-07 — `preprocess_for_ocr` would `AttributeError` on `None` input
**File:** [ocr.py:114-117](src/sidelinehd_extractor/ocr.py#L114-L117)
**Resolved:** Pass 2

Now checks `if image is None` first, then `if not hasattr(image, "shape") or len(image.shape) < 2` as a separate readable guard. Correct fix.

---

#### CR-08 — `process_video` unconditionally SHA-256 hashed the full video
**File:** [processing.py:131](src/sidelinehd_extractor/processing.py#L131)
**Resolved:** Pass 2

`process_video` now takes a `compute_video_hash` parameter. The CLI exposes `--hash-video` (opt-in). Default is no hashing. Correct fix; saves 10–30 seconds on large video files for the common case.

---

#### CR-09 — ~25 CLI arguments duplicated verbatim between `run-game` and `run-youtube`
**File:** [cli.py:462-539](src/sidelinehd_extractor/cli.py#L462-L539)
**Resolved:** Pass 2

Shared arguments are now defined in `_add_run_processing_arguments(parser)`. YouTube-only arguments (`--format`, `--youtube-client`, etc.) remain on `run-youtube` only. The duplication is eliminated.

## Architectural Notes

These are observations on design decisions and trade-offs that do not require immediate action but should inform future work.

### Data flow: smoothed states go to JSONL
`parse_samples_file` writes the *smoothed* states (post `smooth_states`) to `states.jsonl`, not the raw parsed states. This is the correct behavior for auditability — the file represents what the pipeline actually used. The implication is that re-running `detect-events` on a saved `states.jsonl` uses the same smoothed data, but re-running `parse-states` from `samples.jsonl` would re-smooth from scratch. Keep this in mind if you ever add a `--no-smooth` flag for debugging.

### OCR backend extensibility
The `OCRCallable = Callable[[object, str], OCRBackendResult]` type alias and `create_ocr_backend(name)` factory make adding new backends (EasyOCR, PaddleOCR, a vision API) straightforward. The only coupling point is `FIELD_CONFIGS`, which is Tesseract-specific. A future backend may need its own config structure — consider a `backend_config` parameter or per-backend config dict when that time comes.

### `detect_events` parameter growth
`detect_events` has 8 parameters, 5 of which are tuning knobs. This is still manageable. If more tuning knobs are added (e.g., per-overlay-type batter confirmation windows, score-change detection thresholds), a `DetectionConfig` dataclass would clean this up and make per-game config files feasible.

### Corrections as CSV
The CSV corrections approach is simple, auditable, and easy to explain to non-developers. The tradeoff is that collaborative review (two people correcting the same run independently) requires merging CSV files by hand. This is fine for the current single-videographer use case. JSONL correction events would be better for a multi-reviewer workflow but add complexity that isn't warranted yet.

### Package naming
`sidelinehd-extractor` and the `sidelinehd_extractor` module name are SidelineHD-specific. The architecture (normalized templates, configurable regions, pluggable OCR) already supports other overlay systems. Renaming the package is low-priority while the tool is SidelineHD-focused, but the Roadmap correctly flags it as something to revisit before a broader release.
